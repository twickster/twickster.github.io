        <p> This is the first entry in my record of the learning to program journey details things as I go. It's primary purpose is to help provide some kind of accountability that will urge me to keep pushing on. I am going to make a commitment to add an entry at least once a week even it if it is just a few lines to say that I have done some reading.</p>
        <p>I have never been one for blogging and that remains true even now so I have no grand visions of some great flashy blog, just some simple texts to keep me chugging along in my coding journey</p>
        <p>My first forray into this world has been a busy one it has saw the construction of this ugly site that I shall continue to tinker with and hopefully slowly improve it. I am aware that the nav does not work properly but I am currently at a loss as to how to fix it and these triangles are proving a nightmare with positioning and really messes things up when I reduce the window.</p>
        <p>The start of my journey has also seen me create an account on Github (obviously) though I am still confused as to it's working as my messy update/pull request log will attest to. I have also made an account on CodePen, I wish I knew about that site earlier I see a lot of potential there.</p>
        <p> My actual programming started with codecademy but after banging into several bugs the latest of which is preventing my progress through the lessons and the less than steller reception from staff to my forum post has me questioning my continuation and I have since cancelled my sub. This brings in free code camp that seems similar to the former but better fleshed out with the promise of being able to get into real world coding once I tramp my way through the basic courses.</p>
        <p> Finally I have come into contact with items while not directly for the act of programming are a requirement to get along well. This is something I am vaugely aware of but have yet to find any good resources to learn about them. I know I need to find some kind of basic computer science education somewhere as well as such things as workflow. I have also heard mention of this mystical thing call a 'breakpoint' and other than that it is used for debugging I have no idea how to implement such a thing, I am assuming it is a print statement?</p>
        <p> As for tangiable additions to what I have done so far, I am now the proud creator of a CodePen tribue page, please <a href="https://codepen.io/twickster/pen/PzJmOd">click here to see it!</a> </p>
        <p> my plan for the comming week is to hope that codecademy fix there game breaking bug in the Sass lesson, and to plod along with free code camp. This should be easy as their next task is to create a portfolio website something that I have already started on, so it will give me a chance to dedicate that time to tinkering on this site trying to improve things.
        <P> That is all for now! </P>
