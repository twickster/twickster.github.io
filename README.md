A learners first abomination to practise websites and to display future abominations.

This is a simple website to practice my coding and to provide something with others to look at if they are responding to a help request
from somewhere. For the time being due to my level it is not "serious" and I have taken the liberty of having a little fun with the wording etc.

Please feel free to provide feed back as this will help my learning immensely.
